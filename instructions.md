# Spring 2022 CS170 Project Instructions
You must have Rust (and Cargo) installed to run the code.
One of our strategies relies on LP, which calls [Cbc](https://projects.coin-or.org/Cbc) to solve the problem.
This means you must have Cbc installed, which you can install following the instructions [here](https://github.com/coin-or/Cbc). (On Windows, use WSL for easier installation).

Once you have everything set up, you can run the code simply by running `cargo run --release` from the command line.
